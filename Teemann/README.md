Teemann
===

This programm is a simple variation of ["Hase Theodor"](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2017/1/1488464563901699) presentet from the german journal Make.

I added a 7-segment-display which shows the chossen minutes letting the tea steep. The Timebutton add a minute to the steeping time. After nine minutes is reached the counting starts again with one.
